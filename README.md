# DSN Token üè¶

This repository contains the contract code for the DSN Token

The $DSN token‚Äîthe governance token of the Descent Protocol, allows those who hold it to vote on changes to the Descent Protocol. 
Note that anyone, not only $DSN holders, can submit proposals for an $DSN vote.

## Design Considerations

The $DSN token has 3 methods of use within the Descent Protocol 

- As a utility token
    - As xNGN stability fees earned on Vaults accrue within the Descent Protocol, 
    $DSN holders can use $DSN to vote to enable the the auction module to sell xNGN surplus for $DSN.  Once the auction is complete the $DSN protocol burns the $DSN.

- As a governance token
    - $DSN is used by $DSN holders to vote for the risk management and business logic of the Descent Protocol. Tokens are a simple representation of voting power.

- As a recapitalization resource
    - $DSN can autonomously be minted by the auction module and sold for xNGN, which is used to recap the Descent Protocol in times of insolvency.
