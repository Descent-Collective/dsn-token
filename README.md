# OSN Token üè¶

This repository contains the contract code for the OSN Token

The $OSN token‚Äîthe governance token of the Onboard Protocol, allows those who hold it to vote on changes to the Onboard Protocol. 
Note that anyone, not only $OSN holders, can submit proposals for an $OSN vote.

## Design Considerations

The $OSN token has 3 methods of use within the OSN Protocol 

- As a utility token
    - As xNGN stability fees earned on Vaults accrue within the Onboard Protocol, 
    $OSN holders can use $OSN to vote to enable the the auction module to sell xNGN surplus for $OSN.  Once the auction is complete the $OSN protocol burns the $OSN.

- As a governance token
    - $OSN is used by $OSN holders to vote for the risk management and business logic of the Onboard Protocol. Tokens are a simple representation of voting power.

- As a recapitalization resource
    - $OSN can autonomously be minted by the auction module and sold for xNGN, which is used to recap the Onboard Protocol in times of insolvency.
